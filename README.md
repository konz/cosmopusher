Work in progress!

Reads and parses data from Nellcor N560 pulse oximeters and sends it to AWS IoT for further processing. Intended to be
used on a Raspberry Pi connected via serial port to the pulse oxy. 

Processing of the data -- e.g. monitoring, analytics -- will be developed in other projects.
